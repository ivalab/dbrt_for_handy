These are the additional files needed to run a pick-and-place experiment.

Setting Up Handy.txt outlines how to set up the robot as well as some other useful commands in running an experiment.

pickplace.cpp is a replacement for the corresponding file in the ivaHandyExperiments package in the ivalab github, the other two python scripts are for retrieving an image from the kinect and processing them, though they will likely need tweaking in order to work.

The experiments also utilize the grasp_multiObject_multiGrasp package from the ivalab github, as well as the freenect kinect package.
